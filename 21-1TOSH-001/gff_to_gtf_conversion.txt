#For converting gff file to gtf AGAT tool was used (https://github.com/NBISweden/AGAT)

#Following steps were used
#step1: Docker image was pulled for agat version 0.9.1
> docker pull quay.io/biocontainers/agat:0.9.1--pl5321hdfd78af_0 

#step:2 - keep bison.liftoff.gff in /tmp directory

> cp bison.liftoff.gff /tmp

#step:3 - bison.liftoff.gff was load/mount within container agat:0.9.1 and the conversion was done using agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl function. The 
#output is stored in 
> cd /tmp

> docker run -v ${PWD}:/agat quay.io/biocontainers/agat:0.9.1--pl5321hdfd78af_0 agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff agat/bison.liftoff.gff -o agat/bison.liftoff.gtf

#step3 was exisitng after parsing 59% of the file. it generated following error

gff3 reader warning: primary_tag error @ telomerase_rna still not taken in account! Please modify the json files to define the feature in one of the levels

#There were two lines in gff file with this information. Lines with telomerase_rna information was removed from gff file and reran step 3

> grep -vwE "telomerase_RNA" bison.liftoff.gff > bison.liftoff_rm_telomerase_RNA.gff 

> docker run -v ${PWD}:/agat quay.io/biocontainers/agat:0.9.1--pl5321hdfd78af_0 agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl --gff agat/bison.liftoff_rm_telomerase_RNA.gff --relax > bison.liftoff_rm_telomerase_RNA.gtf
