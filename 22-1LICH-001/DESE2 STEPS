DESEQ2 STEPS. (https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/04_DGE_DESeq2_analysis.html), https://github.com/hbctraining/DGE_workshop/tree/master/lessons

 DESeq2 will model the raw counts, using normalization factors (size factors) to account for differences in library depth. 
 Then, it will estimate the gene-wise dispersions and shrink these estimates to generate more accurate estimates of dispersion 
 to model the counts. Finally, DESeq2 will fit the negative binomial model and perform hypothesis testing using the Wald test 
 or Likelihood Ratio Test.


1. PREFITERING

2. NORMALIZATION

3. EXPLORATORY PLOTS: UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING (PCA, Hierarchical Clustering Heatmap) [TO REMOVE FOR OUTLIERS)

4. MODELING RAW COUNTS FOR EACH GENES (ESTIMATE SIZE FACTOR, ESTIMATE GENE WISE DISPERSION, FITTING CURVE TO GENE WISE DISPERSION ESTIMATES,
                                       SHRINK GENE WISE DISPERSION ESTIMATE, GLM FIT FOR EACH GENES)

4. TESTING FOR DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION (WALD TEST , LRT)

5. Heatmap, Volcano Plot,
